    <p>Its name comes from the species' Arabic name: <em>fanak</em></p>
    <p>The fennec fox is a small crepuscular fox native to the deserts of North Africa, they can be found in territories such as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Western Sahara</li>
        <li>Sinai Peninsula</li>
        <li>Arabia</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Its most distinctive feature is its <strong>unusually large ears</strong>, wich serve to dissipate heat and listen for underground prey.<br>
        Its coat, ears and kidney fuctions have adapted to de desert environment with high temperatures and little water.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some <strong>characteristics</strong> of the specie:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Family: Canidae</li>
        <li>Type: Mammals</li>
        <li>Diet: Omnivore</li>
        <li>Weight: 2.2 to 3.3 pounds</li>
        <li>Size: 9.5 to 16 inches; tail: 7 to 12.2 inches</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
        The fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild.<br>
        Its main predators are the <em>eagle owl</em>, jackals and other large mammals. Fennec families dig out burrows in the sand<br>
        for habitation and protection.

        In the wild, fennec foxes eat insects <em>—particularly grasshoppers and locusts—</em> as well
        as small rodents, lizards, birds and their eggs.<br> 
        They will also consume roots, fruits and leaves,which help them to hydrate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, it is considered an <strong>exotic pet.</strong>
